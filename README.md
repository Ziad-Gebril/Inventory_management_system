Inventory Management System

A Java-based Inventory Management System that provides full CRUD operations and business logic around managing inventory, employees, customers, and products.

🔍 Overview

This application helps organizations maintain and monitor stock levels, customer-product relationships, and staff management. Core functionalities include:

Product management: Add, update, delete, and view product details

Customer-product relationships: Track which customers purchase which products

Employee management: Maintain employee records, roles, and assignments

Database persistence: Use a relational database to store all inventory, customer, and employee data

Utility modules: Helper classes and common functions to support core logic

Console / menu interface: A main menu entry point (e.g. MainMenu.java) for navigating application operations

🛠️ Architecture & Structure

Typical modules / packages include:

product/ — product entity, DAO, service

customer_product/ — linking customers with products

employee/ — employee entity, operations

database/ — DB setup, connection utilities

Admin/ — administrative operations or higher-level features

utils/ — common utilities (validation, formatting, etc.)

MainMenu.java — entry point for running the application

The system relies on Java (100% codebase in Java) as the implementation language.
